# 👀 Before Tasting

> [!TIP] **Color matters**  
> Shades should look natural. Pistachio glowing neon green or lemon shining bright yellow? Likely boosted with colorants.  

> [!TIP] **Respect the season**  
> Strawberry in January? That’s a red flag. Authentic gelato follows the rhythm of fresh fruit.  

> [!TIP] **Volume tells the truth**  
> If the gelato stands up tall above the tray like whipped cream, it may be puffed up with artificial stabilizers.

## 😋 After Tasting

- **Pure flavor** → Raspberry should taste like biting into a fresh raspberry, not like syrup.  
- **Smooth texture** → Good gelato melts naturally in your mouth. It should never feel greasy or sticky.  
- **The water test** → Drink a glass of water. If the taste won’t fade, chances are it’s overloaded with sugar and fats.
