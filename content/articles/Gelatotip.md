Even the best gelaterie, in order to meet high demand, sometimes use semi-finished products for certain flavors. These can be high-quality, but they are still industrial products. However, every good gelateria has a few signature flavors they truly excel at — and with those, you can never go wrong. Explore has gone in search of the best gelaterie and their top flavors: check out our guides to discover them!

How to recognize artisanal gelato

Before tasting:
	•	Color: it should look as natural as possible. A neon-green pistachio or a bright canary-yellow lemon are signs of artificial coloring.
	•	Out-of-season flavors: finding strawberry in January, for example, can indicate the use of industrial bases rather than fresh fruit.
	•	Volume: gelato piled high above the rim of the tray may suggest artificial ingredients that puff it up and extend shelf life.

After tasting:
	•	Flavor: it may sound obvious, but raspberry gelato should taste like real raspberries. When you close your eyes, it should feel like eating the fruit itself.
	•	Texture: quality gelato melts gently in your mouth — it’s neither greasy nor watery. If it sticks to your palate, it may contain too many added fats, typical of semi-finished products.
	•	Water test: if, after drinking a glass of water, the gelato flavor doesn’t fade but lingers strongly, it could be a sign of excess sugar and fats rather than genuine artisanal production.

Remember! Even the best gelaterie sometimes rely on semi-finished products for a few flavors, but they always have their “strong points”: signature flavors made with care and real quality. Explore has selected the best gelaterie and their standout flavors — check our guides to find them!
